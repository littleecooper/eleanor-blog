## 6th June 2024
Today I had put all my coding and tech development time into applying for the Autumn CFG course. I am hoping I get this opportunity as it will help to fill in knowledge gaps and upskill. 

I am currently also learning how to commit my work onto GitHub by using the Git Status command on the terminal as I have added this blog onto GuitHub. I have noticed everytime I do Git Status it will notify me if any changes have happened and then if I type Git add . (dot meaning everything)into the termial and then when I type Git Commit it will go onto the terminal. I was so proud of myself for putting this into practice after learning about it from the MOOC sprint provided by Code First Girls. 

1. Complete my changes onto the document(s)/code
2. Type in `git status` onto the terminal. This will show you all of the modified file names.
3. See if any modifications have been made (they will come up in red)
4. OPTIONAL; Do `git diff` to view the changes 
5. If you are happy, type `git add .` (the `.` will stage all modified files). Alternatively you can do `git add path/to/file` to stage a specific file.
6. Then you type `git commit -m "your commit message"` (the `-m` stands for message) 
7. The modified file(s) will then turn green instead of red
8. Then type `git push` and this "push" your changes to your remote GitHub repository. 

Or I can use the vscode git UI.

I had started off the day with completing another section of Mimo where it was testing all my current knowledge around the basics of HTML. I was tested on how to write a heading, create a paragraph, write a link and place images on the screen. I was so happy when I had answered all these questions correctly, I did have to think a lot about adding a link as I was unsure if I had spelt the 'href' correctly as I was aware of me keep spelling it as 'herf. I am so pleased I have now drummed this spelling into my head. 

I was going to continue with my MOOC sprint today and had then noticed that CFG had released their autumn CFG degree applications! I was so excited to see which opportunities they had for full stack development. When I had arrived home after work, I looked onto their website and there were two courses I was interested in. The first one was:

Activision/Blizzard - it is an education only opportunity and they had a full stack development course. This peaked my interest because playing games has recently become a healthy avenue for me to de-stress and relax after work.

dstl; The Science Inside - This one is also education only and their opportunities are more focused on data analysis. Despite being more focused on full stack development, data science is something I do want to explore in more detail once I am more fmailiar with full stack development as it would be an additional useful tool that can help businesses to grow. I liked this company because it is about the defence system within the UK and the government sounds like an organisation that focuses on diversity and hearing opinions and working with different perspectives would be beneficial in developing my tech knowledge and skills. 

Either way, I am so IMPRESSED of all the learning opportunties that CFG provides so I am going to give it a shot and apply for this cohort - wish me luck!! 

## 3rd June 2024

I did more learning on Mimo today as I was strained for time after working in the pharmacy today. I was still determined to do a bit of coding even if it was only a little bit. Today's Mimo session was a recap, I was nearly caught out with the different attribute titles - src is for images and href is for links. I nearly had said src is for links which is incorrect. 

I am pleased I did this recap, it allowed me to realise that I am progressing and showed me my weak points. HTML is a programming structure that I wish to continue learning. 


## 2nd June 2024

I felt it was important for me to revise everything I had learnt in the CFG MOOC course from the previous day and had decided to acheive this by taking the first quiz. I was so happy to have answered all the questions correctly! I was unsure of the last two questions which were about Git status (specifically untracked files) and how version control systems deal with mistakes. These are things that I want to start practicing more of to help solidify this knowledge. I am still over the moon that I had answered all these questions correctly, I am eagar to now start session two of the CFG GitHub MOOC which I will now start. 

40 minutes later..... 

![Gitbranches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/dornfeder/13abff279de357f048e474d4ed6c692d/raw/2dbb70c4b14f3b83170a139649b6ff496f15d05a/example-diagram.svg)

I have completed some of the session and had learnt the definition of branches and what their purpose is. This session has taught me that the main branch is the main piece of code (the green line in the pictute next to me) and you can make a pull request to then create another branch and you use this branch to be able to experiment with the code. This helps to keep the main code in tact whilst the developer is making improvements. The next part of this session is going to focus on creating code branches which I am looking forward to learning more about. 


## 1st June 24 

I decided to carry on with my the MOOC course hosted by CFG about Git and GitHub. I completed the first session today and learnt more about basic linux commands and initialising a local Git respository. I found it interesting how we use the terminal to be able to interact with the computer and able to cammand it into starting functions. I learnt the commands of pwd (print working directory), Is (list files and directory) and cd (change directory). For the local respoitory, I was amazed at how interactive this process is and the different stages of merging code. For example, I learnt more about the staging area and how this section can allow you to add your current work from the directory and if needed, bring it back to the directory if you need to make additional changes to it before it is fully committed.

Git init was a useful repository/command for me to learn as this also helps to start initialising the local repository. Admittedely, I am still a little confused about how this works as I need to practice it more on my GitHub account but I am happy to have learnt more knowledge around it. Another useful one I had learnt about was Git Status. This is a command code that informs the user of the branch you are on and of any untracked files. Like with the other command, I will have to use this in real life more before I can fully appreciate their use. At this point, I don't know what a branch is (expect for the ones on trees) but i am looking forward to learning more about this! 



## 31st May 2024 

I had started off the day with learning how to put images onto HTML. I found this enjoyable because it really helped to make this blog look more interesting. It was starting to look like a massive block of text so being able to add a few images of things I like helps to break up the text but also make it more aesthetically pleasing. I had learnt three more attributs which were src (source), height and width. After playing around with these concepts for a bit, it made me realise how i am interested in front end development and engaging in content that would look visually pleasing for the user. 

![Anya](https://a.storyblok.com/f/178900/1920x1080/21f84a6d49/e64be766aa2a3ce3811fc5a31454a0d71663339986_main.jpg/m/filters:quality(95)format(webp) "alt")

After practicing with images, I decided to challenege myself to a puzzle on HackerRank. Today's puzzle focused on learning about Nested lists (lists within lists) and was given a problem where we had to retirve the student with the second lowest score. In this data, there were two students with the same score who were second lowest. In this case, we had to then retrieve their names and put them in an alphanetical order on seperate lines. I had used 2 for loops, if statements and functions inclusing .append and .sort to be able to acheive this outcome. I initially struggled with this as I was unaware of the .sort function and learning that this function helps to put the lists in order was a game-changer. I also struggled with understading how for loops work and had spent time watching more youtube tutorials on for loops and browising coding websites like W3Schools to find a solution to my problem. With much dedication and caffine, I finially found a solution that passed all the tests and then contributed this code onto my GitHub account under my HackerRank Puzzles respiritory. 

As I was on GitHub, I noticed there was all this terminology that I haven't come across before like repository, branches and push and pull requests. I felt uneasy putting my HackerRank code out there incase I was using GitHub incorrectly. This inspired me to sign up to a Massive Open Online course (MOOC) with a company called Code First Girls which focuses on learning what Git and GitHub is. There are 4 sessions in this MOOC and I had completed half of the first one where I was learning more about what a version control system is, the terminal and where the command line is. I had been using a command line already as I have started this website but I didn't know there was an offical title for it. Overall, it has been a productive day today ! 

## 30th May 2024

I was updating this blog and was going through my past experiences of code and realised that I could put my Pokemon Top Trumps Code onto GitHub. I had dedicated time today in updating this blog and also learning how to navigate GitHub. This is crucial for the tech industry because learning how to use GitHub would be crucial to gain inspiration from others projects and learn from their past coding experiences. 

As I had already completed coding projects before buying this website, I decided to also add a section about my coding journey before creating this blog. 

## 29th May 2024

I had learnt on Mimo today how to create links on HTML using the href attribute. I had also learnt that attributes do not require a closing tag and are stored inside an opening tag. 

These are examples of syntaxes I have learnt today.

## 27th May 2024

I was going through all my notes today and had discovered the importance of Github and was learning more about it. As I am starting out, I decided it was crucial to set up an account and start exploring other peoples coding material. Despite not learning any code today, I am starting to feel like I am getting all the necessary tools needed to become an open-minded software developer. 

## 20th May 2024

I had decided to check out the CFG website to look at additional courses to gain more experience and had signed up to a course they provide called MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). There are two categories, one is a MOOC sprint where it provides the learner with tech knowledge (programming languages and problem solving skills). The second option is a MOOC challenge which provides you with an opportunity to test the knowledge and skills that you have learnt. This involves assigning the learner a task or project that tests your problem solving abilities and is based around real life challenges. 

As I am still a beginner, I had enrolled onto several MOOC sprints which I aim to complete over the next couple of weeks. 

## 15 May 2024

On Mimo, I had learnt about opening and closing tags in HTML. This session on Mimo had taught me about the syntax of HTML and which functions have opening and closing tags and which ones do not. The following structures have opening and closing tags: 

<button>, </button> - creates a button

<em>, </em>  - makes the text italic

<strong>, </strong>  - makes the text bold

I had practiced to code for a button on my blog and it initally was not appearing on the screen and had error codes. After researching and reading help guides on HTML I soon discovered that I had put a backwards slash in the closing tag instead of a forward slash. This was a good learning curve from today. 

## 12th May 2024

I had attended the free introductory seminar with She Codes today. It was an incredible expeiernce and had learnt the importance of learning more about React and how this tool is increasingly being used for the majority of desktop and mobile applications. 

 SheCodes also used an anology to explain the differences between the different layers of code required to create an effective and functioning website. The analolgy was compared to a human body where HTML provided the website with structure (the skeleton), CSS provides the presentation of the wesite (clothes and make up) and the Javascript produces the functions (organs and muscles). While I appreciate this isn't the only method of building a website, it was a good basis to gain the knowledge and understanding all the different layers involved in creating a website. 

 This SheCodes seminar had then started to explain the different job roles and their responsbilities within the tech sector. They explained how a front end developer is involved in the way a product/website is percieved and how others interact with it. In comparision, a backend developer looks after the functions and is more server based. 

## 5th May 2024

 Today I had conducted more research and had discovered another company called SheCodes. I signed up to do a free introductiory course on the 12th May. I am looking forward to being able to explore a different learning environment and assessing their course structure, opportunities and the learning enviornment.

## 1st May 2024

I decided to buy a website to start writing a blog about my coding journey. This decision was inspired by an app called Mimo which is currently teaching me how to write HTML. Mimo is a mobile application that aims to help those begin their career journey into coding. I downloaded this mobile app because it allowed me to keep up with learning programming even on days where I may not have had the time to dedicate to intense lessons (Consistency is important for me). As this has been useful thus far, I have been finding difficulties in remembering the information as i am not practicing it on a daily basis and what better way to learn then to have first hand experience of practicing these skills. Due to this, I have created this website to not only to solidify my HTML skills but to also use it as a portfolio of all the coding work I have been engaging with. 


## What have I accompolished before this website ? 

University was a time when I was just starting to figure out my career path and exploring different skill sets. One of my favorite subjects was statistics—there's something fascinating about looking at datasets, performing analyses, and finding patterns in the data. As a psychology student, understanding statistical analysis and data entry was crucial. Luckily, my partner is a software engineer, and he helped me countless times by writing short coding programs to process my data quickly. What would have taken me hours to do manually took just minutes with code. I was so impressed that I decided to dive into coding myself!

Python was my first choice because it's one of the most universal coding languages. It overlaps with other languages and has tonnes of resources to learn from. I stumbled upon Codecademy and enrolled in their Python 2 course, along with a course on learning R. Codecademy gave me a good introduction to coding, but it felt a bit isolated with not enough coding challenges to practice my skills.

That’s when I discovered Code First Girls (CFG), a company dedicated to getting more women into the tech sector by teaching essential coding skills. In November 2023, I enrolled in their Kickstarter course to get a more structured learning experience. This course was a pivotal moment for me. It made me realise that working in an innovative environment is the best way to create effective and creative projects. By the end of the course, I had created a Pokémon Top Trumps game (check out my GitHub account linked above!). I chose this project because it involved creating my own code around loops, if statements, and REST APIs—concepts which I initially found challenging. And I won't mention of course that I am a massive pokemon nerd so this was a no brainer! Working on this project helped me understand these concepts in more detail and practice them, which will definitely come in handy for future projects.

Through CFG, I also learned about HackerRank, a platform that gives you broken code to debug. It's been a fantastic tool for enhancing my tech skills. 

Coding has opened up a whole new world for me, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this field!
