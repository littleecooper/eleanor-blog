## 18th of September 

I have just listened to the whole session of session 4 and have made a few detailed notes. It was interesating to learn about arrays and the push and pop method in javascript. I want to mess around with arrays a bit more to fully understand them so I may make myself a challenge around them and see if I can turn them into a game. Maybe I can use them as a pokedex where the person will write in a number and then it will tell them the pokemon that fits that index? This is something for the future to think more about. This is something I want to practice more as it will help to practice my skills and solidify my knowledge. 


## 17th September 

I had completed session 3 of the MOOC sprint and learnt about Null and undefined data types. I then completed the MOOC 3 quiz and scored 4/4. I am finally understanding Jacascript more and wish to start doing my own code around this! 

## 14th September 

Today I am going to spend more time completing the MOOC sprint for the Javascript course facilitated by CFG. After I am up-top-date with this, I aim to spend my coding time preparing for the 'Get into Tech' application for the sky course and also start to change the style of my website and create more mini games to uploads onto my GitHub account. I have so much coding to look forward to which I am excited about! :) 

I had learnt about Boolean operators today in detail which are as follows: 

&& - AND - returns true if BOTH values are true otherwise, it will return a flas value

|| - OR - returns true if one or both values are true 

! - NOT - this flips the value and should be placed infront of the value. 

When the tutor was going through a demo on this, I had noticed that in the syntax of the code that the ! operator would be infront of the vairable. For instance, in her example she had used the example of scary movies and had the syntax as follows: 

let isScary = true
let hasPillow = false

if (isScary && !hasPillow) {
    console.log("I will not watch this!)
}

I was proud of myself for noticing the syntax and learning the syntax of all these moderators so quickly and also for remembering that Let is used when a value is constanlty changing and thats why const wasn't used in this instance because both the values could change depending on the persons circumstances. 

Javascript does not have captialised booleans BUT python does. I had learnt this from my husband who is a software engineer. 

## 12th September 

I have decided that I am going to go full steam ahead with the Javascript MOOC as I want to complete this before the end of September so then I can focus more time on the 'Get into Tech' sky course. This MOOC is important because the sky course will have a module on Javascript, CSS and HTML. I have learnt a lot of HTML through a mobile app called Mimo. 

Today I am going to be starting with session 3 which involves learning about conditional statements, logical operators, functions and data types. I had gone through conditional statements and logical operators this evening. This was a good refresh as I had learnt about if/else statements before in the python kickstarter course but I had learnt the syntax of these conditional statements in Javascript. This was a good coding session for me! 


## 11th September 

Today I had spent my coding session completing session two of the Javascript MOOC sprint and answering the quiz questions. I thoroughly enjoyed this session because we had learnt about comparison operators and was given a demo to see how you can use this within data. For example, we were shown how to ask somebody their age as the hockey club was for adults so they had to ensure the applicant was over 18. In addition, I had learnt about the primitative data type called Booleans that give you true or false based on the data conditions. 

This session had also highlighted the importance the difference between let and const.

Const = variables that do not/ will not change


let = a variable that can be reassigned 

This was an interesting session and I had learnt more about coding in Javascript. I had completed the quiz and scored 4/4 on my first try. I was so happy about this!! Looking forward to completing session 3 soon. 

## 10th September

Today has been exciting because the sky 'Get into Tech' course has provided dates on when applications will go live - this is the 30th of September! Applications will close the 1st of November so I will have plenty of time to apply to this in between. I am going to work to the best of my ability in the meantime and put my upmost effort into it! The dates are officially in the diary. 

I am now going to spend a little bit of time going over session 2 for the MOOC sprint for Javascript. In this, I was learning about the prompt function and the MOOC course had inspired me to create my own little piece of code where I was aiming to make a program that will convert GBP into Yen. I had chosen yen because I am going to Japan next May. I had started this code in Javascript but unfortunately it is still not working as of yet. This is something that I am deciding to accompolish in the upcioming months. However, I had also decided to learn this piece of code in Python in which I had achieved! 

A learning curve I had wigth this currency converter is that in the JS file, it was not working because I only had a single Javascript file and it was not yet connected to a CSS or HTML file so the question wasn't popping up on another page. This is something I will explore next time I work on it. 

In addition, my python file of my currency converter had come up with an error. This is because I was trying to times an interger number with a float number (the currency exchange itself) and python was erroring with this. To overcome this, I put the float() function in front of the gbp variable and this fixed the piece of code. I then uploaded my python file onto github. Was a super productive session today. 


## 5th September 

I am going to spend today catching up on my MOOC sprint as I missed session two on wednesday due to my laptop issues. I am hoping I will get a good chunk completed today and can then complete the quiz for week 2. This means I will be up-to-date with my Javascript MOOC. I am then going to link it onto my GitHub account. 

I have been religiously checking the 'Get into Tech' sky application and it has not yet opened. I want to start doing some application preparation for them so as soon as it opens I will be prepared. I wish to apply asap as this would be an incredible oppoirtuinity to reduce knowledge gaps that I have in the tech world. This is why I am currently doing a MOOC with Javascript because it is in one of the modules for this course and it will give me a head start into the programme if I am a successful candidate. This is why I am going to continue with this. 

In the MOOC today I had learnt about a different way to concatenate variables called interpolation and it can be recognised with backticks (`). US dollar signs (¢) and the curley brackets ({}). The syntax for merging these variables together are as follows: 

const greeting = `¢{emoji} ¢{greeting} ¢{emoji}` 

This example I had copied from the CFG course but I thought it would be useful to include in this entry as a reminder of what interpolation looks like. 

## 4th September 

I have had a bit of a sad day today. I have spent the past couple of months wiriting in the blog about things that I have been doing with my coding but unfortunately my laptop had died and I didn't push any of it onto github which means I have lost a lot of work in this time. This has allowed me to learn the hard why how important it is to regularly push all your work onto Github after you have completed it. I am going to take my laptop to the apple store over the upcoming week and hopefully they will be able to get it working today. 

Incase they are unable to do that, here is what I have accompolished over the past xouple of months: 

- created a FizzBuzz game in Python - the user types in a number and the computer will tell it whether it is Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz up until the number they have typed in (Fizz = denominator of 3, Buzz = denominator of 5 and FizzBuzz = denominator of 3 and 5). 
- Completed a GitHub Massive Online Class (MOOC) facilitated by Code First Girls
- Started another MOOC about Javascript 
- Challenged myself to another python challenge where the computer guesses a number from 1-100 and the uswer has to predict it using prompts from the computer. 

Today I had spent my coding time finishing a recap for session 1 (did the first class last week and completed the quiz) and started writing notes for session two. 


## 23rd June 2024

I have come back to coding after a week break, things have been super busy but I have managed to keep revising and keeping in touvh with my tech progessions. I had completed the application itself and the video interview for my CFG degree Activision blizzard position. I felt like I perfomed the best I could and am now anxiously waiting for a response. I am hoping ym passion came through and how I want to go above and beyond to make a career in the tech industry. 

I may have to take a bigger step back from learning coding as I have a wedding coming up so my attenton is a bit divided but I am still determined to become an entry level developer for a full stack position. 

Today I had continued my MOOC sprint on GitHub and had learnt the following commands for branches: 

Git Branch "name of branch"
. This creates a new branch 

Git Switch "name of branch you want to go to" 
. Switch to that exisiting branch 

Git checkout - b "branch name" 
. Creates a new branch and immediately switches to it 

Git branch - d "branch name" 
. Deletes the branch you have stated in the branch name 

Git Branch 
. Lists all the branches


## 7th/8th June 2024

I had spent this weekend solely focusing on my Autumn CFG degree application for the Acitivison/Blizzard Full stack development role. I have been talking about my GitHub MOOC Sprint and also talking about this blog. I have good feelings about this apllication so I am keeping my fingers crossed!! 

I aim to focus more on the MOOC sprint now that I am close to finishing my CFG degree application.  

## 6th June 2024
Today I had put all my coding and tech development time into applying for the Autumn CFG course. I am hoping I get this opportunity as it will help to fill in knowledge gaps and upskill. 

I am currently also learning how to commit my work onto GitHub by using the Git Status command on the terminal as I have added this blog onto GuitHub. I have noticed everytime I do Git Status it will notify me if any changes have happened and then if I type Git add . (dot meaning everything)into the termial and then when I type Git Commit it will go onto the terminal. I was so proud of myself for putting this into practice after learning about it from the MOOC sprint provided by Code First Girls. 

1. Complete my changes onto the document(s)/code
2. Type in `git status` onto the terminal. This will show you all of the modified file names.
3. See if any modifications have been made (they will come up in red)
4. OPTIONAL; Do `git diff` to view the changes 
5. Press Q to quit out of Git diff
5. If you are happy, type `git add .` (the `.` will stage all modified files). Alternatively you can do `git add path/to/file` to stage a specific file.
6. Then you type `git commit -m "your commit message"` (the `-m` stands for message) 
7. The modified file(s) will then turn green instead of red
8. Then type `git push` and this "push" your changes to your remote GitHub repository. 

Or I can use the vscode git UI.

## 5th June 2024

I had started off the day with completing another section of Mimo where it was testing all my current knowledge around the basics of HTML. I was tested on how to write a heading, create a paragraph, write a link and place images on the screen. I was so happy when I had answered all these questions correctly, I did have to think a lot about adding a link as I was unsure if I had spelt the 'href' correctly as I was aware of me keep spelling it as 'herf. I am so pleased I have now drummed this spelling into my head. 

I was going to continue with my MOOC sprint today and had then noticed that CFG had released their autumn CFG degree applications! I was so excited to see which opportunities they had for full stack development. When I had arrived home after work, I looked onto their website and there were two courses I was interested in. The first one was:

Activision/Blizzard - it is an education only opportunity and they had a full stack development course. This peaked my interest because playing games has recently become a healthy avenue for me to de-stress and relax after work.

dstl; The Science Inside - This one is also education only and their opportunities are more focused on data analysis. Despite being more focused on full stack development, data science is something I do want to explore in more detail once I am more fmailiar with full stack development as it would be an additional useful tool that can help businesses to grow. I liked this company because it is about the defence system within the UK and the government sounds like an organisation that focuses on diversity and hearing opinions and working with different perspectives would be beneficial in developing my tech knowledge and skills. 

Either way, I am so IMPRESSED of all the learning opportunties that CFG provides so I am going to give it a shot and apply for this cohort - wish me luck!! 

## 3rd June 2024

I did more learning on Mimo today as I was strained for time after working in the pharmacy today. I was still determined to do a bit of coding even if it was only a little bit. Today's Mimo session was a recap, I was nearly caught out with the different attribute titles - src is for images and href is for links. I nearly had said src is for links which is incorrect. 

I am pleased I did this recap, it allowed me to realise that I am progressing and showed me my weak points. HTML is a programming structure that I wish to continue learning. 


## 2nd June 2024

I felt it was important for me to revise everything I had learnt in the CFG MOOC course from the previous day and had decided to acheive this by taking the first quiz. I was so happy to have answered all the questions correctly! I was unsure of the last two questions which were about Git status (specifically untracked files) and how version control systems deal with mistakes. These are things that I want to start practicing more of to help solidify this knowledge. I am still over the moon that I had answered all these questions correctly, I am eagar to now start session two of the CFG GitHub MOOC which I will now start. 

40 minutes later..... 

![Gitbranches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/dornfeder/13abff279de357f048e474d4ed6c692d/raw/2dbb70c4b14f3b83170a139649b6ff496f15d05a/example-diagram.svg)

I have completed some of the session and had learnt the definition of branches and what their purpose is. This session has taught me that the main branch is the main piece of code (the green line in the pictute next to me) and you can make a pull request to then create another branch and you use this branch to be able to experiment with the code. This helps to keep the main code in tact whilst the developer is making improvements. The next part of this session is going to focus on creating code branches which I am looking forward to learning more about. 


## 1st June 24 

I decided to carry on with my the MOOC course hosted by CFG about Git and GitHub. I completed the first session today and learnt more about basic linux commands and initialising a local Git respository. I found it interesting how we use the terminal to be able to interact with the computer and able to cammand it into starting functions. I learnt the commands of pwd (print working directory), Is (list files and directory) and cd (change directory). For the local respoitory, I was amazed at how interactive this process is and the different stages of merging code. For example, I learnt more about the staging area and how this section can allow you to add your current work from the directory and if needed, bring it back to the directory if you need to make additional changes to it before it is fully committed. 

![Tree](https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/tree-branch-isolated-white-background_1308-120942.jpg?w=826&t=st=1717263051~exp=1717263651~hmac=7405347f26bec9fd2d2101275828b5070b3052df752694b354b4d87b8f80f845)

Git init was a useful repository/command for me to learn as this also helps to start initialising the local repository. Admittedely, I am still a little confused about how this works as I need to practice it more on my GitHub account but I am happy to have learnt more knowledge around it. Another useful one I had learnt about was Git Status. This is a command code that informs the user of the branch you are on and of any untracked files. Like with the other command, I will have to use this in real life more before I can fully appreciate their use. At this point, I don't know what a branch is (expect for the ones on trees) but i am looking forward to learning more about this! 



## 31st May 2024 

I had started off the day with learning how to put images onto HTML. I found this enjoyable because it really helped to make this blog look more interesting. It was starting to look like a massive block of text so being able to add a few images of things I like helps to break up the text but also make it more aesthetically pleasing. I had learnt three more attributs which were src (source), height and width. After playing around with these concepts for a bit, it made me realise how i am interested in front end development and engaging in content that would look visually pleasing for the user. 

![Anya](https://a.storyblok.com/f/178900/1920x1080/21f84a6d49/e64be766aa2a3ce3811fc5a31454a0d71663339986_main.jpg/m/filters:quality(95)format(webp) "alt")

After practicing with images, I decided to challenege myself to a puzzle on HackerRank. Today's puzzle focused on learning about Nested lists (lists within lists) and was given a problem where we had to retirve the student with the second lowest score. In this data, there were two students with the same score who were second lowest. In this case, we had to then retrieve their names and put them in an alphanetical order on seperate lines. I had used 2 for loops, if statements and functions inclusing .append and .sort to be able to acheive this outcome. I initially struggled with this as I was unaware of the .sort function and learning that this function helps to put the lists in order was a game-changer. I also struggled with understading how for loops work and had spent time watching more youtube tutorials on for loops and browising coding websites like W3Schools to find a solution to my problem. With much dedication and caffine, I finially found a solution that passed all the tests and then contributed this code onto my GitHub account under my HackerRank Puzzles respiritory. 

As I was on GitHub, I noticed there was all this terminology that I haven't come across before like repository, branches and push and pull requests. I felt uneasy putting my HackerRank code out there incase I was using GitHub incorrectly. This inspired me to sign up to a Massive Open Online course (MOOC) with a company called Code First Girls which focuses on learning what Git and GitHub is. There are 4 sessions in this MOOC and I had completed half of the first one where I was learning more about what a version control system is, the terminal and where the command line is. I had been using a command line already as I have started this website but I didn't know there was an offical title for it. Overall, it has been a productive day today ! 

## 30th May 2024

I was updating this blog and was going through my past experiences of code and realised that I could put my Pokemon Top Trumps Code onto GitHub. I had dedicated time today in updating this blog and also learning how to navigate GitHub. This is crucial for the tech industry because learning how to use GitHub would be crucial to gain inspiration from others projects and learn from their past coding experiences. 

As I had already completed coding projects before buying this website, I decided to also add a section about my coding journey before creating this blog. 

## 29th May 2024

I had learnt on Mimo today how to create links on HTML using the href attribute. I had also learnt that attributes do not require a closing tag and are stored inside an opening tag. 

These are examples of syntaxes I have learnt today.

## 27th May 2024

I was going through all my notes today and had discovered the importance of Github and was learning more about it. As I am starting out, I decided it was crucial to set up an account and start exploring other peoples coding material. Despite not learning any code today, I am starting to feel like I am getting all the necessary tools needed to become an open-minded software developer. 

## 20th May 2024

I had decided to check out the CFG website to look at additional courses to gain more experience and had signed up to a course they provide called MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). There are two categories, one is a MOOC sprint where it provides the learner with tech knowledge (programming languages and problem solving skills). The second option is a MOOC challenge which provides you with an opportunity to test the knowledge and skills that you have learnt. This involves assigning the learner a task or project that tests your problem solving abilities and is based around real life challenges. 

As I am still a beginner, I had enrolled onto several MOOC sprints which I aim to complete over the next couple of weeks. 

## 15 May 2024

On Mimo, I had learnt about opening and closing tags in HTML. This session on Mimo had taught me about the syntax of HTML and which functions have opening and closing tags and which ones do not. The following structures have opening and closing tags: 

<button>, </button> - creates a button

<em>, </em>  - makes the text italic

<strong>, </strong>  - makes the text bold

I had practiced to code for a button on my blog and it initally was not appearing on the screen and had error codes. After researching and reading help guides on HTML I soon discovered that I had put a backwards slash in the closing tag instead of a forward slash. This was a good learning curve from today. 

## 12th May 2024

I had attended the free introductory seminar with She Codes today. It was an incredible expeiernce and had learnt the importance of learning more about React and how this tool is increasingly being used for the majority of desktop and mobile applications. 

 SheCodes also used an anology to explain the differences between the different layers of code required to create an effective and functioning website. The analolgy was compared to a human body where HTML provided the website with structure (the skeleton), CSS provides the presentation of the wesite (clothes and make up) and the Javascript produces the functions (organs and muscles). While I appreciate this isn't the only method of building a website, it was a good basis to gain the knowledge and understanding all the different layers involved in creating a website. 

 This SheCodes seminar had then started to explain the different job roles and their responsbilities within the tech sector. They explained how a front end developer is involved in the way a product/website is percieved and how others interact with it. In comparision, a backend developer looks after the functions and is more server based. 

## 5th May 2024

 Today I had conducted more research and had discovered another company called SheCodes. I signed up to do a free introductiory course on the 12th May. I am looking forward to being able to explore a different learning environment and assessing their course structure, opportunities and the learning enviornment.

## 1st May 2024

I decided to buy a website to start writing a blog about my coding journey. This decision was inspired by an app called Mimo which is currently teaching me how to write HTML. Mimo is a mobile application that aims to help those begin their career journey into coding. I downloaded this mobile app because it allowed me to keep up with learning programming even on days where I may not have had the time to dedicate to intense lessons (Consistency is important for me). As this has been useful thus far, I have been finding difficulties in remembering the information as i am not practicing it on a daily basis and what better way to learn then to have first hand experience of practicing these skills. Due to this, I have created this website to not only to solidify my HTML skills but to also use it as a portfolio of all the coding work I have been engaging with. 


## What have I accompolished before this website ? 

University was a time when I was just starting to figure out my career path and exploring different skill sets. One of my favorite subjects was statistics—there's something fascinating about looking at datasets, performing analyses, and finding patterns in the data. As a psychology student, understanding statistical analysis and data entry was crucial. Luckily, my partner is a software engineer, and he helped me countless times by writing short coding programs to process my data quickly. What would have taken me hours to do manually took just minutes with code. I was so impressed that I decided to dive into coding myself!

Python was my first choice because it's one of the most universal coding languages. It overlaps with other languages and has tonnes of resources to learn from. I stumbled upon Codecademy and enrolled in their Python 2 course, along with a course on learning R. Codecademy gave me a good introduction to coding, but it felt a bit isolated with not enough coding challenges to practice my skills.

That’s when I discovered Code First Girls (CFG), a company dedicated to getting more women into the tech sector by teaching essential coding skills. In November 2023, I enrolled in their Kickstarter course to get a more structured learning experience. This course was a pivotal moment for me. It made me realise that working in an innovative environment is the best way to create effective and creative projects. By the end of the course, I had created a Pokémon Top Trumps game (check out my GitHub account linked above!). I chose this project because it involved creating my own code around loops, if statements, and REST APIs—concepts which I initially found challenging. And I won't mention of course that I am a massive pokemon nerd so this was a no brainer! Working on this project helped me understand these concepts in more detail and practice them, which will definitely come in handy for future projects.

Through CFG, I also learned about HackerRank, a platform that gives you broken code to debug. It's been a fantastic tool for enhancing my tech skills. 

Coding has opened up a whole new world for me, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this field!
